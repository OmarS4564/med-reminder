# MedSync

MedSync is a simple, privacy-first iOS/Android app that helps people take their medication on time and avoid running out.

The app is designed around two main screens:

- Today — shows all scheduled doses for the current day in chronological order. You can mark doses as *Taken* or *Skipped*. If any medication is running low, a refill banner appears at the top.
- Medications — where you add, disable, or delete medications. For each medication you specify:
  - name and dose
  - one or more daily times
  - pills remaining
  - pills per dose
  - a refill threshold

All data is stored locally on your device. The app schedules daily local notifications for each medication time and automatically updates them when you add, remove, or disable a medication.
